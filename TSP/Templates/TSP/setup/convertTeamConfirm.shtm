<h1>Confirm Team Project Conversion</h1>

<div style="background-color: #ff5050; text-align:center; font-weight: bold; border: 1px solid black; padding:5px">
Please read all of the important information below before proceeding!
</div>

<p>When you create and set up a team project, you select a metrics
collection framework that will be used to characterize team data.  The
framework you choose becomes the "dictionary" that gives meaning to the
metrics the team collects.</p>

<p>Because of this, the metrics collection framework of a team project
normally does not change.  But in certain unusual circumstances, a team may
need to convert their project data to a different metrics collection
framework.  This <b>provisional</b> tool is provided to perform that
conversion.</p>

<p>Conversion will require participation from all of the team members,
<u>past and present</u>:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>First, the team leader will
click the "Continue" button below.  This will immediately convert the
project data that resides in the Team Dashboard.</li>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>Next, <u>each</u> team member
will receive an alert in their personal dashboard, advising them that a team
sync is needed.<ul>

  <li>When they acknowledge the alert, they will be told that the team
      project is converting to a new metrics framework, and that their
      cooperation is needed to facilitate this conversion.</li>

  <li>Next, their personal plan will be scanned for potential problems that
      could interfere with the conversion.  The conversion tool will print a
      list of any problems that are found, and the team member will need to
      correct these problems before they can continue.  Depending on their
      familiarity with the dashboard, individuals may need assistance to
      correct some of these problems.</li>

  <li>If no problems are found (or when no problems remain), the conversion
      will begin:

      <ul>
      <li>Their data will be backed up;</li>
      <li>Their personal dashboard will be shut down.</li>
      <li>The conversion tool will transform their personal plan.</li>
      <li>Finally, their dashboard will be restarted.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

  </ul>

</li></ol>

<p>Once the conversion has started, it should be a high priority for
individuals to successfully convert their data.  <b>Team members will be
unable to perform a regular "Sync to WBS" operation until their data has been
successfully converted.</b></p>

<p><b>All team members</b> must successfully convert their data, or
portions of the team rollup will be incorrect.  If this team has old
members who are no longer involved in the project, you must find a way
to launch their old personal dashboard and convert their personal
plan.</p>

<p><b>Also</b>, be aware that your historical team data will require manual
attention.  At the moment, all of your team's historical data was collected
using the current metrics collection framework.  When you change to the new
framework, many historical data elements will no longer make sense.  It
will be necessary for the team to manually:</p>

<ul>

<li>Open the Work Breakdown Structure, and repair the type of each
component or task.</li>

<li>Open the Common Team Workflows and repair the type of each component or
task.</li>

<li>Open the Defect Log Editor in each team member dashboard, and
fix the "Injection" and "Removal" phases to refer to the phases in the
new metrics collection framework.</li>

<li>Open the Size Inventory Form in each team member dashboard, and repair
the size units on each sized object.</li>

</ul>

<p>Until all of these corrections are made, the team rollups will display
incorrect data.</p>

<p>Finally, this conversion tool is provisional in nature.  If any
problems occur during the conversion process, it may be necessary to
contact the Process Dashboard development team for immediate support.
Therefore, you should not initiate the conversion process during a
time-sensitive phase of your team project.  Make contact with the
Process Dashboard development team before starting conversion; select
a timeframe when team members can set aside an hour or so to convert
their personal data; then initiate the conversion process.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> if your team is migrating data from an old-style metrics
collection framework to the new style, it is allowed (and encouraged) to
perform both steps together.  Team members will only have to go through the
migration process once.</p>

<p>Clicking the "Continue" button below will irreversably start this
conversion process.</p>

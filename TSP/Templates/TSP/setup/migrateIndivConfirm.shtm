<h1>Team Project Migration Needed</h1>

<p>Your team leader has chosen to migrate this team project to a new,
streamlined data format.  This will provide several benefits for you,
such as a reduction in memory usage and faster export operations on
shutdown.</p>

<!--#else-->

<h1>Team Project Conversion Needed</h1>

<p>Your team leader has chosen to convert this team project to a
different metrics collection framework.  This will enable the team
to analyze metrics in new and different ways.</p>

<!--#endif-->


<p>Your cooperation is needed for this effort.  When you click the
"Continue" button below, the dashboard will take the following
steps:</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>First, your personal
plan will be scanned for potential problems that could interfere with
the <!--#echo operation -->.  If any problems are found, the dashboard
will display a list of corrective actions that you need to take.  In
most cases, no problems will be detected, so the <!--#echo operation -->
will begin right away.</li>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>Next, your personal
Process Dashboard will be shut down to perform the <!--#echo operation -->.
The <!--#echo operation --> tool will upgrade your personal plan to
the new data format, then restart your dashboard.</li>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>After the dashboard
restarts, it may be necessary for you to perform a final "Synchronize
to WBS" operation. The dashboard will alert you if this sync is
needed.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Please note:</b> Until you complete the steps above, the
dashboard will not be able to copy new task assignments from the team
work breakdown structure.  Thus, you should attempt to finish the
<!--#echo operation --> as soon as possible.  If you encounter any
problems during the <!--#echo operation -->, contact your team leader
right away for help.</p>

<p>If you are ready to begin the <!--#echo operation --> process,
click the "Continue" button below.</p>

<p>This wizard relies upon functionality that was introduced in
version 1.10.5 of the Process Dashboard.  However, the following
member(s) of this team are still using an older version:</p>

<ul>
<!--#foreach name=Person list=[move//Out_Of_Date_Team_Member_List] -->
    <li>Person</li>
<!--#endfor-->
</ul>

<p>If you continue with the move, the personal plans for these
individual(s) will continue pointing at the old team data directory
until they correct the locations manually. The last data they exported
will continue to be available in the team rollup. However, they will
not be able to edit the WBS or export updated data until they manually
repair their team data directories.</p>

<p class="error">Are you certain you want to continue, even if these
team members become disconnected from the team project?  If the
individuals above are still involved in the project, it is strongly
recommended that you stop, and resume the move after all team members
have upgraded.</p>

<P>The team-oriented processes in the dashboard use a &quot;team
directory&quot; to facilitate coordination.  This directory will be used to
hold team-level planning information, such as the project's work breakdown
structure.</P>

<p>The &quot;team directory&quot; must be accessible and readable by the
leaders of all the team projects associated with this master project.
Because of this, it should generally be a shared network directory.<p>

<p>The team-oriented processes in the dashboard use a &quot;team
directory&quot; to facilitate coordination.  The primary purpose of
this directory is to hold exported snapshots of individual data; the
team project instance imports this data and uses it to compute
rolled-up team data.</p>

<p>The &quot;team directory&quot; must be accessible, readable, and
writable by all team members.  Because of this, it should generally be
a shared network directory.  Since the directory will hold PSP data
collected by individuals, it should be configured with permissions
that forbid file access by non-team members.<p>

<!--#endif-->

<p>Any number of projects can share the same team directory; the
process dashboard will still be able to track which data belongs to
which project.  (This is true even if the projects are using different
team processes.)  Thus, if you have a team which is performing several
projects (or project phases) one after another, it is not necessary to
create a new team directory for each project/phase.</p>

<p>If the members of your team are predominately using the Microsoft
Windows operating system, the use of a UNC path is strongly
recommended.  That is, you would enter the directory path as
<tt>\\serverName\path\to\directory</tt> instead of
<tt>T:\path\to\directory</tt>.</p>

<h1>Confirm Team Project Migration</h1>

<div style="background-color: #ff5050; text-align:center; font-weight: bold; border: 1px solid black; padding:5px">
Please read all of the important information below before proceeding!
</div>

<p>The Process Dashboard has introduced a new, streamlined data format for
team projects.  When you create a new team project with this version of the
Process Dashboard or later, it will use the streamlined new data format.
Older team projects will continue to use the previous data format.  Both
formats are equally acceptable; historical data can be rolled up from new-
and old-style team projects without difficulty.</p>

<p>Most teams should plan on using their current, old-style team project
until the end of an iteration.  When performing a launch or relaunch, you are
encouraged to create a new team project.  This will allow you to benefit from
new functionality, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Round-trip synchronization of plan data between the WBS and the personal
    plans of each team member</li>

<li>Display of actual metrics (time, % complete, % spent, completion date)
    for the tasks in the WBS Editor</li>

<li>The ability to rebalance "remaining work" in the WBS Editor</li>

<li>A reduction in memory footprint for personal dashboards, and faster
    export times for personal data</li>

</ul>

<p>In certain circumstances, a team may want to take advantage of this new
functionality, but they may not be in a position to start fresh with a new
team project.  In those cases, they may choose to migrate their current
project from the old data format to the new data format.  This
<b>provisional</b> tool is provided to perform that migration.</p>

<p>Migration will require participation from all of the team members:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>First, the team leader will
click the "Continue" button below.  This will immediately and
<u>irreversably</u> migrate the project data that resides in the Team
Dashboard.</li>

<li style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em'>Next, <u>each</u> team member
will receive an alert in their personal dashboard, advising them that a team
sync is needed.<ul>

  <li>When they acknowledge the alert, they will be told that the team
      project is migrating to a new data format, and that their cooperation
      is needed to facilitate this migration.</li>

  <li>Next, their personal plan will be scanned for potential problems that
      could interfere with the migration.  The migration tool will print a
      list of any problems that are found, and the team member will need to
      correct these problems before they can continue.  Depending on their
      familiarity with the dashboard, individuals may need assistance to
      correct some of these problems.</li>

  <li>If no problems are found (or when no problems remain), the migration
      will begin:

      <ul>
      <li>Their data will be backed up;</li>
      <li>Their personal dashboard will be shut down.</li>
      <li>The migration tool will streamline their personal plan.</li>
      <li>Finally, their dashboard will be restarted.</li>
      <li>They may need to perform a final "Sync to WBS" to finish the migration.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

  </ul>

</li></ol>


<p>Once the migration has started, it should be a high priority for
individuals to successfully migrate their data.  <b>Team members will be
unable to perform a regular "Sync to WBS" operation until their data has been
successfully migrated.</b></p>

<p>One other point is worth mentioning: if the team has old members who are
no longer involved in the project, it may be difficult to launch their
personal dashboard and migrate their personal plan.  Although this scenario
is less than ideal, it isn't a showstopper.  The old-style data from those
individuals will still roll up into the new-style team project.  However,
vestiges of the old-style data format will still be visible in various
reports and tools.  (For example, their actual data will not flow back into
the WBS, so in the WBS their tasks will never appear to be complete.)</p>

<p>Finally, this migration tool is provisional in nature.  If any problems
occur during the migration process, it may be necessary to contact the
Process Dashboard development team for immediate support.  Therefore, you
should not initiate the migration process during a time-sensitive phase
of your team project.  Make contact with the Process Dashboard development
team before starting migration; select a timeframe when team members can
set aside an hour or so to migrate their personal data; then initiate the
migration process.</p>


<p>Clicking the "Continue" button below will irreversably start this
 migration process.</p>

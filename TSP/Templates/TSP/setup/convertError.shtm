<h1>Team Project Conversion Error</h1>

<!--#if notTeamProject -->
    <p>&quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; does not appear to be
    a team project.</p>

<!--#elif notSupportedMaster -->
    <p>&quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; is a <u>master</u>
    project.  Conversion of master projects is not supported at this
    time.</p>

<!--#elif isReadOnly -->
    <p>The Team Dashboard is currently running in read only mode.  No
    changes can be made.</p>

<!--#elif noOtherTeamProcesses -->
    <p>This tool is designed to convert your team project from one
    metrics collection framework to another.  However, you currently
    have <b>only one</b> metrics collection framework installed - so
    there are no alternative frameworks to convert this project to.
    Please install the target metrics collection framework, restart
    the team dashboard, and try the conversion again.</p>

<!--#elif noTargetPIDSelected -->
    <p>You did not select a target metrics collection framework to
    convert this project to. Please press the back button and try
    again.</p>

<!--#elif targetPIDIsNoChange -->
    <p>You have requested to convert this project to the
    &quot;<!--#echo targetPID -->&quot; metrics collection framework.
    <b>It is already using that framework</b>, so there are no changes
    to be made.</p>

<!--#elif targetTemplateNotInstalled -->
    <p>You have requested to convert this project to the
    &quot;<!--#echo targetPID -->&quot; metrics collection framework.
    Unfortunately, that process seems to be missing, corrupt, or
    somehow incompatible with the current framework.</p>

<!--#elif belongsToMasterProject -->
    <p>This team project is currently a member of the
    &quot;<!--#echo [Master_Project_Path] -->&quot;
    master project.  The conversion process will make this team
    project incompatible with that master project.  Thus, you
    must remove this project from the master project before you
    can continue.</p>

<!--#elif noTeamDataDir -->
    <p>The conversion tool will need to make changes in the Team
    Project Network Directory.  However, you have not specified the
    location of that directory.  Please correct this problem on the
    <a href="../team_project_parameters.shtm">project parameters</a>
    page, then try again.</p>

<!--#elif cannotFindTeamDataDir -->
    <p>The conversion tool will need to make changes in the Team
    Project Network Directory.  According to the 
    <a href="../team_project_parameters.shtm">project parameters</a>
    page, this directory is:

    <PRE style="margin-left: 1cm"><!--#echo [Team_Directory_Eff] --></PRE>

    Unfortunately, that directory could not be found.  You may need to
    map a network drive.  Please correct this problem and try again.</p>

<!--#elif hierarchyEditorOpen -->
    <p>The Hierarchy Editor is currently open.  Please close the
    Hierarchy Editor and try again.</p>

<!--#elif cannotConvert -->
    <p>&quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; can not be converted
    
    <!--#if bridgedMode -->because the dashboard is currently running
        in bridged mode through a team server.  The conversion tool
        does not run within a bridged dashboard instance at this time.

    <!--#elif dirClasspath -->because the dashboard is currently
        running from unpackaged class files instead of a packaged
	JAR file.

    <!--#endif-->

<!--#elif failedPreconditions -->
    <p>&quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; can not be converted
    until the following problem(s) are resolved:</p>

    <ul>
        <!--#foreach name=errorMessage list=[Failed_Conversion_Preconditions] #-->

<!--#elif generalError -->
    <p>&quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; could not be converted
    due to internal errors.</p>

    <table border><tr><td bgcolor='#ff5050'><b>
    It is strongly recommended that you restart the dashboard to avoid
    residual problems from these internal errors, and send a data
    backup to the Process Dashboard development team for analysis.
